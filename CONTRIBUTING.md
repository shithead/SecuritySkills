# Contributing to SecuritySkills

Thank you for your interest in evolving SecuritySkills. This project is built by security practitioners, for security practitioners — and we pay bounties for quality contributions.

## Bounty Program

> **⏸️ Paused.** The paid bounty program is temporarily on hold. Contributions are still welcome and will be credited; the tiers below describe the program as it will resume — we'll announce timing on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DKTZzfU9B).

We run a paid bounty program for three types of contributions. All bounties are paid within 48 hours of merge/acceptance.

### Tiers

| Tier | What You Do | Bounty | Time Estimate |
|------|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Reviewer** | Review an existing skill and file structured feedback | $25 per review | 30-60 min |
| **Improver** | Submit a PR that improves an existing skill | $50-150 per merged PR | 1-3 hours |
| **Author** | Write a completely new skill from scratch | $200-500 per merged skill | 3-8 hours |
| **Champion** | Sustained, high-quality contributions over a quarter | $1,000 quarterly bonus | Ongoing |

**Payment methods:** GitHub Sponsors, PayPal, or crypto — your choice. We'll confirm your preferred method when your first contribution is accepted.

### How Bounty Amounts Are Determined

- **Reviewers:** Flat $25 per accepted review that follows the review template
- **Improvers:** $50 for minor improvements (typo fixes, doc updates, small logic tweaks), $100 for moderate improvements (new edge case coverage, false positive reduction), $150 for substantial improvements (rewritten detection logic, major coverage expansion)
- **Authors:** $200 for standard skills (well-known vulnerability class, single language), $350 for intermediate skills (multiple languages/frameworks, nuanced detection), $500 for complex/novel skills (novel detection approach, comprehensive coverage, low false-positive rate)
- **Champions:** Top 3 contributors by quality-weighted contribution count each quarter receive a $1,000 bonus

## Quality Rubric

Every submission is scored against this rubric. Minimum **15/23** to qualify for a bounty.

| Criteria | Score Range | What We're Looking For |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Detection Accuracy** | 0-5 | Does the skill reliably catch what it claims to catch? Tested against known-vulnerable code samples? |
| **False Positive Rate** | 0-5 | Has the skill been tested against benign code? Does it avoid flagging safe patterns? Lower FP rate = higher score |
| **Coverage Breadth** | 0-5 | Does it handle multiple variants, languages, or frameworks where applicable? Edge cases? |
| **Documentation** | 0-5 | Clear description, real-world examples, test cases included? Would another practitioner understand why this skill exists? |
| **Originality** | 0-3 | Is this a novel detection approach? Does it catch something other tools miss? Or is it a well-executed version of a known pattern? |

Scores are assigned by UnitOne maintainers. If you disagree with a score, open a discussion — we're happy to explain our reasoning and adjust if warranted.

## Contribution Types

### 1. Skill Review ($25)

Review an existing skill and file a GitHub Issue using the **Skill Review** template.

**What a good review covers:**
- **False positive analysis** — Can you find benign code that this skill incorrectly flags? Provide specific examples.
- **Coverage gaps** — What variants of this vulnerability does the skill miss? Specific languages, frameworks, or patterns.
- **Edge cases** — Unusual but real-world scenarios where the detection or remediation logic breaks.
- **Remediation quality** — Does the proposed fix actually resolve the issue without introducing new problems?
- **Comparison** — How does this compare to equivalent rules in Semgrep, CodeQL, or other tools?

**To submit a review:**
1. Pick a skill from the repository (or check `#bounty-board` in Discord for prioritized reviews)
2. Open a new Issue using the "Skill Review" template
3. Fill in every section of the template
4. Tag your issue with `review`

### 2. Skill Improvement ($50-150)

Improve an existing skill by submitting a Pull Request.

**Types of improvements we value:**
- Reducing false positives (with evidence/test cases)
- Expanding coverage to additional languages or frameworks
- Improving detection logic for edge cases
- Better remediation approaches
- Adding test cases for existing skills

**To submit an improvement:**
1. Fork the repo and create a branch named `improve/[skill-name]-[brief-description]`
2. Make your changes
3. Add or update test cases demonstrating the improvement
4. Open a PR using the "Skill Improvement" template
5. In the PR description, clearly explain what was wrong and what you fixed

### 3. New Skill ($200-500)

Author a completely new security skill from scratch.

**Before you start writing:**
- Check existing skills to avoid duplicates
- Check open Issues for requested skills (these are pre-approved topics)
- If your idea isn't listed, open a "New Skill Proposal" Issue first — we'll confirm it's in scope before you invest time

**Skill structure:**
```
skills/
  [category]/
    [skill-name]/
      skill.yaml          # Skill definition (detection + remediation)
      README.md           # Human-readable description, examples, rationale
      tests/
        vulnerable/       # Code samples that SHOULD trigger the skill
        benign/           # Code samples that should NOT trigger the skill
```

**To submit a new skill:**
1. Fork the repo and create a branch named `new-skill/[skill-name]`
2. Follow the skill structure above
3. Include at least 3 vulnerable test cases and 3 benign test cases
4. Open a PR using the "New Skill" template
5. Be prepared for review feedback — most new skills go through 1-2 revision cycles
