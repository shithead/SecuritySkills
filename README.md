## Why This Exists

AI coding agents can perform security reviews, but they hallucinate framework control numbers, miss entire vulnerability categories, and produce inconsistent output across runs. The result is security guidance that sounds authoritative but falls apart under scrutiny.

These skills ground agents in real published frameworks -- OWASP, NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, and CIS Controls -- so that every finding maps to a verifiable control. They are not prompt dumps. They are structured, framework-referenced, injection-hardened skill files that produce reliable, auditable security output.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UnitOneAI/SecuritySkills.git
cd SecuritySkills
```

**Claude Code** (native format — auto-discovery and `/slash-commands`)

```bash
# Global install — all skills available via auto-discovery and /skill-name
cp -r skills/*/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Or project-local
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r skills/*/* .claude/skills/

# Then use naturally:
# "Review this code for security issues"    → Claude auto-loads secure-code-review
# /threat-modeling                          → Direct invocation
# /cve-triage CVE-2024-1234                 → With arguments
```

**Gemini CLI**

```bash
# Reference skills via @ commands
cp -r skills/ ~/.gemini/skills/
```

**Cursor**

```bash
# Add as Cursor rules
cp -r skills/ .cursor/rules/
```

**Codex CLI / Kiro / Generic**

```bash
# Point any agent at a skill's SKILL.md file
codex --context skills/appsec/threat-modeling/SKILL.md "Review this design"
kiro spec --skill skills/ai-security/llm-top-10/SKILL.md
```

Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Claude Code discovers skills automatically; other tools can load them by path.

## Skill format

Every skill is a **directory** at `skills/<domain>/<skill-name>/` with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

### `SKILL.md` frontmatter

All skills use the same YAML frontmatter fields:

```yaml
name: threat-modeling                 # kebab-case, matches the directory
description: >                        # what it does + when it auto-invokes
  Runs a structured STRIDE threat model on any design, API spec, or codebase...
tags: [appsec, design, architecture]  # domain + activity keywords
role: [security-engineer, architect]  # which role bundles include it
phase: [design, review]               # SDLC phase
frameworks: [STRIDE, MITRE-ATT&CK]    # cited frameworks — real control IDs only
difficulty: intermediate              # beginner | intermediate | advanced
time_estimate: "30-60min"
version: "1.0.0"
author: unitoneai
license: MIT
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob       # tools the skill may use
injection-hardened: true              # reviewed against OWASP LLM01
argument-hint: "[target-file-or-directory]"
# context: fork                       # optional
```

### Progressive disclosure (keep `SKILL.md` lean)

Claude's skill guidance: when a `SKILL.md` would exceed ~500 lines, **don't inline everything** — split detail into sibling reference files in the same directory and link to them from `SKILL.md`. The agent loads a reference only when it needs it, so the entrypoint stays cheap to load.

```
skills/appsec/threat-modeling/
├── SKILL.md                  ← entrypoint (lean): when-to-use, rules, output format
├── threat-actor-profiles.md  ← reference, loaded on demand
└── csharp-dotnet.md          ← language-specific reference
```

This is why some skills ship extra `.md` files alongside `SKILL.md` (e.g. `cloud/aws-review/benchmark-checklist.md`, `compliance/soc2-gap/tsc-criteria.md`) — it is the intended pattern, not duplication.

## What Makes This Different

- **Framework-grounded.** Every skill cites real control IDs from OWASP, NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, or CIS. No invented controls. No hallucinated references.
- **Consistent output format.** Structured findings with severity, CWE mapping, framework reference, evidence, and remediation -- every time.
- **AI-security skills that don't exist elsewhere.** OWASP LLM Top 10, Agentic AI security, prompt injection testing, model supply chain review.
- **Multi-agent compatible.** Same skill file works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, and Kiro.
- **Prompt-injection hardened.** Every skill reviewed against OWASP LLM01:2025. CI scans for injection patterns on every PR.
- **Enterprise-ready.** Built by practitioners, not scraped from blog posts. Designed for real security programs.

## Disclaimer

These skills were built through extensive research against published security frameworks (OWASP, NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, CIS Controls) and reviewed by five specialized AI security agents:

- **CISO Reviewer** — Strategic risk, compliance alignment, and program-level gaps
- **Security Architect** — Framework accuracy, control ID verification, and design patterns
- **Security Engineer** — Implementation correctness, tooling gaps, and operational feasibility
- **AI Security Researcher** — LLM/agentic threat modeling, prompt injection hardening, and ATLAS coverage
- **SOC Analyst** — Detection engineering, alert triage accuracy, and incident response workflows

Despite this multi-layered review process, these skills may contain inaccuracies, outdated framework references, or gaps in coverage. **Validate all control IDs, framework versions, and remediation guidance against authoritative sources before using these skills in production security workflows.** Security frameworks evolve — always cross-reference with the latest published versions.
